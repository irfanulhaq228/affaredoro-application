          This may generate a warning during your build:
          
           > property#android.adservices.AD_SERVICES_CONFIG@android:resource
           > was tagged at AndroidManifest.xml:23 to replace other declarations
           > but no other declaration present
           
           You may safely ignore this warning.
           
           We must include this in case you also use something else
           that may also include this file, because if two modules include it, they
           will collide and cause a build error if we don't set this one to take
           priority via replacement.
